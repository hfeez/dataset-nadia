The service itself is actually good most of the times. But I really don't like how the app FORCES me to rate the service before I can use it to order the next food. I'm hungry. I'm in the mood of good. The way this app refuse to let me order food before I rear the previous driver is ridiculous.,1,negatif,0

Also, the one thing that's kinda annoying is everytime I open the app, it always says to turn on my location service although it's been turned on at the time I open the app. It's a small bug, but it sure is getting annoying overtime. A suggestion from me, simplify the UI & UX again, and don't make the app too heavy for phones to handle, I mean, not everyone is using a high-end spec phone. You don't want people's phone to be able to cook a food, right? I'd surely change the ratings if all of these gets fixed... hopefully...",3,negatif,0

I have one feedback; maybe if you can put ""Open Now"" feature on Go-Food (shows which restaurants are open during the time we use the button) it will be even more fantastic, so we don't have to scroll through every category to see which ones are open. Other than that, keep up the good work. 👍🏻",5,positif,1

"Other features are great, but gopay must be improved. I am using K plus to top up and it takes about 3~4 hours unlike other delivery apps. Also, customers cannot use debit/credit cards to pay directly. Moreover, you need to submit all of your personal information including your passport and your selfie in order to pay even though you have already topped up the money, which is definitely not a pleasant experience. 다른 기능은 준수하나 카드로 직접 계산은 불가능. 돈 충전 후 사용까지 3~4시간이 소요됨. 충전금을 사용하려면 얼굴과 여권사진을 제출해야함.",5,positif,1
